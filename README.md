# Image Processing Training Project

## Description

This project is an image processing tool that uses Boost and OpenCV to perform various operations on images. The "pipeline" reads images from a directory, applies several filters to each image, and saves the processed images back to the disk. The result is images that look like they are from a black-and-white comic. You can find them after executing in the "output" folder.

## Requirements

- Docker: The Docker platform is required to build and run the Docker image.

## How to Execute

1. Navigate in the Terminal to the project directory ("/ImgProcessingPipe").
2. Execute:
```bash
docker build -t img-processing-pipe .
docker build -t img-processing-pipe .
```

The pipeline will process all .png and .jpg images in the images directory and save the processed images back to the disk.
